# Biometric Core Backend

This repository contains the backend for the Biometric Core platform, built with NestJS. The documentation is streamlined to focus on what matters for building and running the service.

- Project Overview: docs/core/project-overview.md
- Project Architecture: docs/core/project-architecture.md
- Project Stack: docs/core/project-stack.md
 - API Response Standard: docs/standards/response-standard.md

Development
- Node.js 24 LTS is the project standard. Use `nvm use` (reads `.nvmrc`) to match the correct version.

Looking for previous notes (framework choices, language strategy, or Express layouts)? Those have been removed to avoid confusion and to fully embrace the NestJS stack.
